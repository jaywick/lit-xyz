Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You can create anything that makes you happy. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.

Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.

There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Isn't that fantastic? The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.

Brown is such a nice color. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. It is a lot of fun. This piece of canvas is your world. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Imagination is the key to painting.

Fluff that up. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.

Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.

You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.
