Some code examples

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { PhotoStory, VideoStory } from './stories'

const components = {
    photo: PhotoStory,
    video: VideoStory,
}

function Story(props) {
    // Correct! JSX type can be a capitalized variable.
    const SpecificStory = components[props.storyType]
    return <SpecificStory story={props.story} />
}
```

```info pro tip
Some admonitions
```

And [^1] more including some ABBR syntax

```jsx
const Button = (props) => {
    const { kind, ...other } = props
    const className = kind === 'primary' ? 'PrimaryButton' : 'SecondaryButton'
    return <button className={className} {...other} />
}

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Button kind='primary' onClick={() => console.log('clicked!')}>
                Hello World!
            </Button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Remember that `false`, `null`, `undefined`, and `true` are not rendered in JSX.
