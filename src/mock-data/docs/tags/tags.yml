  hero: ./heroes/newsfeed.png
  story: Newsfeed was born from my dislike of relying on social networks like Reddit or Twitter for news. There were too many distractions, spammy content and irrelevant ads and recommendations. I loved the new look of Google News but it never surfaced my chosen sites properly. I knew the sites I liked. I just wanted to see their headlines, no signing up, no background downloads, no god-awful unread count making it a chore to keep up. Something a bit nicer for my digital wellbeing, but something that still catered for my need for an information fix.

  story: My interest in word clocks led me to make a screensaver on my phone for just that. Given its popularity with whom saw it running, I decided to make it available for everyone on the Play Store. It simply displays the current time, but in words while you have your phone charging or docked.

      It’s no secret I love my jet fighters. It’s their superiority over the skies, their pure power and engineering that goes into these machines that make then so amazing. It was a few years ago during a boring lecture, I started drawing sketches for a jet fighter game. Every existing title had bored me so far, it had neither the excitement nor the overkill I craved.

      That night for fun I did some research into game engines and ended up making a group of cylinders and boxes roll across a mountainous terrain. My addiction to this game grew and so did the encouragement of my friends who all wanted their hands on early betas.

      So the Blackstorm Alpha project was conceived, and at one point I had about fifteen good friends have their hands on the evolving game. Be sure to check out the videos videos and blog posts about it!

      In the Autumn of 2009, long before Android Auto and Apple Carplay, my best friend and I realised how disheartened we were by the UX of touch screen car entertainment systems and decided to start the project to build one ourselves.

      With the advent of Android Auto and Apple Car Play, this project became redundant. But these are the adventures we had a long the way in developing it.
